== Installation ==

Installing Novo-Map is really a question of minutes.

1. In the WP plugin dashboard, click 'Add new' and search for 'Novo-Map' and click 'Install now'
1. After clicking 'Add new', you can also navigate to the 'Upload' area and choose the `novo-map.zip` file that you can download here on wordpress.org
1. You can also directly upload the novo-map plugin to the `/wp-content/plugins/` using FTP.
1. Then you just need to click on 'Activate' and it's done.

= Create your first Map =

1. Click on the 'Novo-Map' menu to access the main menu of the plugin
1. Then the first thing you need to do is to generate and save your google map API key (it's required by google and it's the same for every google map plugin). click on the 'Get API key' button on [This Page](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) and follows the few steps requiered. It really takes 1 minute! Then save the generated key in the novo-map menu.
1. When it's done, choose 'Create a new map' in the drop down menu.
1. Choose a title for your new map and click the 'Create Map' button at the bottom of the page (you can leave the default options for now).
1. Go in your post menu and edit one of your posts. There is now a Novo-Map menu available.
1. Just click on the map to add a latitude and a longitude to your post. Title, image and description should be prefilled with your post title, featured image and post excerpt if they exists. Then just click on the 'Add Marker' button
1. Go back on the main novo-map menu and chose the map you just created from the drop down menu. You should see the pin you just created in the preview.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Generate a Google Map API Key =
Generate a google map API key can be frustrating but it is required by google and it is the same for every google map plugin. But don't worry it's really not that complicated. Just click on the 'Get API key' button on [This Page](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) and follows the few steps requiered (you will need to add your billing credentials but you will have [28'000 map downloads/months for free](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/pricing/sheet/)). It really takes 1 minute! Then save the generated key in the novo-map menu.

= Display the same map with different parameters ? =
Using the novo-map shortcode, you can easily overwrite some default parameters. By default, you would just use the shortcode like this : `[novo-map id=1]` But you can actually provide many other parameters to overwrite the parameters defined in the map menu. This can be really useful if you want to display the same map centered differently or with a different zoom.
Here are the parameters you can use (you can provide only a few of them) :

`
[novo-map
id=1,
name='my map title',
width='400px',
height='300px',
category='categoryID',
tag='tagID',
latitude=12.2345,
longitude=26.34512,
zoom=6
]
`

= Add the Novo-Map menu for custom post types =
By default, the novo-map menu is only enabled for posts and pages. But you can simply and the following filter in your theme functions.php file to customize this. Here is an example with a testimonial custom post type:
`
add_filter( 'novo_map_allowed_post_type', 'novo_map_post_types' );
function novo_map_post_types($types) {
    $types = array( 'post', 'page', 'testimonial' );
    return $types;
}
`
The default is: array( 'post', 'page');

= Map displaying in the admin and the preview but not in the frontend =
There is a good chance there is a conflict with an optimization plugin like Autoptimize. You might find some useful infos to solve this kind of problem on [this thread of the support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/novo-map-not-showing/)

== Screenshots ==

1. Example of a map with some nice custom icons and a nice custom theme created on snazzy maps.
2. Example of the marker clustering to avoid having 200 markers overlapping each other.
3. Example of an opened Infobox when clicking on a marker.
4. Main admin menu page with map preview.
5. Post admin menu page to easily geolocate a post or page and customize the content of the infobox.
6. Marker menu to easily create your own custom markers.
